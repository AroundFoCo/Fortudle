# Fortudle
Fortudle is a weekly FoCo word guessing game powered by code from the original Wordle.

Guess the FORTUDLE in 6 tries. Each guess must be a valid 5 letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the colour of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Green: The letter is correct, in the correct position.
Yellow: The letter is correct, but in the wrong position.
Grey: The letter is incorrect.
The answer will be a word/place/FoCoism related to Fort Collins in some way.

A new FORTUDLE will be available each week!
